# Manage Teams & Users

### Manage Your Teams&#x20;

TerminusCMS generates a team based on your registration credentials.&#x20;

The pricing page is the first screen displayed when logging in for the first time, click on '**Get Started**' under the community package. The next screen is the teams home page that lists all of the teams a user belongs to.&#x20;

Create a new team or select the autogenerated team. All of the teams a user is a member of will appear on the team's home page. Switch between teams using the dropdown from the top menu.

To create a new team from the top menu:

1. Click the arrow next to the profile icon in the top right corner.&#x20;
2. Select profile.&#x20;
3. From the resulting window, select ‘Create a new team’&#x20;
4. Name the team - note that no two team names can be the same.

### **Adding Users**

To invite team members and manage the team, do the following:

1. Click the arrow next to your profile icon in the top right corner.&#x20;
2. Select 'Team Members'.
3. In the following screen, select 'Invite a Member'.&#x20;
4. In the pop-up window, enter the user’s email address and select one of the following access permissions - _this will be applied to team-level permissions so will apply to all data products within your team. If you want to only give read-write access to a specific data product, it makes sense to give the user low-level permissions and assign higher permissions for that data product only - we will explain this next_.&#x20;
   * Admin - can add and remove users and permissions and has total access to data products.&#x20;
   * Collaborator - Able to access data products.&#x20;
   * Data Updater - Read and write access to data products.&#x20;
   * Data Reader - Read-only access to data products. Info Reader -&#x20;
   * Schema-level access but not data-level access.&#x20;
5. The user will be sent an email with a link they need to click (if they don’t receive it, tell them to check their spam folder).&#x20;
6. When the user has accepted the invitation, their details will display within the Team Members section.

### **Editing & Removing Users**

To edit the role given to a user:

1. Navigate to the Team Members section from the profile dropdown.
2. Find the user to change from the list and click on the second icon.&#x20;
3. From the pop-up window, select the new role to give them.

To delete a user from a team, do the same as above, but select the third icon in red.

{% hint style="info" %}
Hover over the icons for information about what they do.
{% endhint %}

### **Granular Permissions**

Grant different permissions for different data products/projects. To do this do the following:

1. Navigate to the Team Members section from the profile dropdown.&#x20;
2. Find the user to add specific data product permissions for and click on the first icon.&#x20;
3. The resulting table below will list all of the data products in the team.&#x20;
4. Choose the data product to change the user’s role for by clicking on the edit permissions icon.&#x20;
5. Choose from the list of permissions

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/14-dashboard-granualar-access.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
Users can only have permissions higher than the team permissions, so if someone needs read/write permissions for only one data product, ensure that the team permissions are set at a lower level.
{% endhint %}
