# Introduction to TerminusDB

### What is TerminusDB?

TerminusDB is a powerful, in-memory graph database enabling you to maximize your productivity and the value of your data. TerminusDB has numerous features and several interfaces enabling you to create data-intensive, immutable, and synchronized databases with built-in version control and other [Git-like](terminusdb-intro.md#git-like-model) operations.

### Why choose TerminusDB?

A few of the many reasons to choose TerminusDB as your graph database solution:

#### An enterprise-level graph database

Enterprise-level availability, functionality, performance, scalability, and stability. TerminusDB is a data-intensive, in-memory, high-speed and scalable platform suitable for both small and enterprise-level applications.

#### Quick and easy to use

Maximize your productivity and start realizing the value of your data by having your databases up and running in a few minutes. Easily create, query, and maintain your databases using graphical and programmatic interfaces.

#### Feature-rich and Git-like

Numerous unique features and [Git-like](terminusdb-intro.md#git-like-model) operations including clone, branch, merge, control and time-travel. TerminusDB databases are immutable, fully preserving data lineage and change history with built-in revision control, similar to distributed version control systems.

#### Advanced query language

A powerful query language enabling fast and recursive searches across complex data patterns.

#### Forms and data validation

Generate forms for viewing and entering data with automatic data validation.

#### Visual model builder

Use a lightweight Graphical User Interface to easily build, maintain and enforce complex data models.

#### Multiple interfaces

Create and maintain your databases using programmatic interfaces such as JavaScript and Python APIs.

#### Data-centric collaboration

TerminusDB is highly configurable with powerful features for rapidly and collaboratively creating synchronized, application-centric and data-centric databases. Maximize productivity through application and data-centric distributed development and collaboration.

### Git-like model

TerminusDB has many Git-like features including revision-control and distributed collaboration. Similar to Git, TerminusDB is open source, model-driven, and uses the **Resource Description Framework** ([RDF](../glossary.md#rdf)) specification for collaboration.

#### Delta-encoding

TerminusDB implements an advanced Git-like model, using [delta encoding](../glossary.md#delta-encoding) to store append or delta-only changes to graphs. These deltas are stored in succinct [terminusdb-store](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-store) data structures. The delta encoding approach enables branch, merge, push, pull, clone, time-travel, and other Git-like operations.
